# Customer_behavior_analysys
📊 Data Analytics Project

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from data loading and exploration to insights generation and visualization. The goal is to analyze the dataset, clean and transform it, extract insights using SQL, and present results through an interactive Power BI dashboard and a professional report.

The project showcases practical skills in Python, SQL, data visualization, and business reporting.

📂 Dataset

The dataset was loaded and analyzed using Python.

It contains structured data suitable for exploratory analysis and querying.

Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed to handle:

Missing values

Duplicates

Inconsistent data types

Outliers (where applicable)

(Dataset source can be mentioned here if public or anonymized if private.)

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python – Data loading, cleaning, and EDA

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

SQL – Data querying and analysis

PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

Power BI – Interactive dashboard creation

Gamma – Presentation (PPT) creation

Git/GitHub – Version control and project sharing
